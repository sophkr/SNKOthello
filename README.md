# SNKOthello
Othello program that uses alpha-beta to optimize computer move. Designed to be played with a referee that allows this program to play another. The referee code is not supplied in this repository, however the game can still be tested by playing against the computer. Initialize the game by typing "I B" to intiate the computer as black. Then type your move from the available moves list by typing W (col) (row) for example "W a 5".
